# Civlike

A Civ-like 4X game made in Rust using the Bracket-lib roguelike library

# Notes on this branch
This is in a separate branch because it's in progress code of me trying to set up the unit system for the game.
Currently, the only thing you can really do is move your cursor over the unit and see information about it, eventually
you'll be able to take control and move the unit and perform other actions with it.
